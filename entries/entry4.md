# Entry 4: Getting Something to Work in Java

## Eclipse

One of the teammates that I'm working with found this website and saw that this is perfect for writing and running and launching code for Java. It's downloadable so nothing gets saved to the cloud.... Great idea teammate... So I have to find out a way that we each have our code and not have to contantly repeat code that one of us three just previously wrote.

# Codenvy

I was snooping around the website that one of my teammate told about downloading from. I saw a place called "cloud". I remember in class about the cloud, it can save things to the internet.

BINGO!


I told my teammates to get on "Codenvy" and look around at it. Sure enough is just like Ecplise but we dont know how to run anything or to lauch anything from it.

# Finding our black space

Now that we have Eclipse and Codenvy side by side, one to write, correct and launch code, and the other one to save, send,  and proofread. I'm not a hundred percent accurate if people have done this in the past but, this works and it's not complicated.

## Takeaways

#### 1. Sometimes using one thing isn't enough, having multiple things to help you cruise might be more helpful

#### 2. When your teammates find things, make sure everthing is checked off the checklist.
